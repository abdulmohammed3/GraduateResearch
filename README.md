# Facial Expression Recognition: Addressing Gender Bias
## Overview
This research explores the challenges of gender bias in facial expression recognition (FER) systems. It employs five deep learning algorithms—Sequential, ResNet-50, DenseNet, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3—to evaluate their performance and fairness across diverse datasets. The study aims to provide comprehensive insights into the demographic effects on FER and the efficacy of different models in mitigating gender bias.

### Objectives
- To assess the performance of various deep learning models in FER tasks.

- To identify and quantify gender bias in FER systems using statistical and bias metrics.

- To explore methodologies for mitigating gender bias in FER technologies.

## Methodology
#### Algorithm Selection:

- Sequential
- ResNet-50
- DenseNet
- MobileNetV2
- InceptionV3
#### Datasets:

- Male-only
- Female-only
- Mixed-gender

### Key Findings
- The emotion "Disgust" is most susceptible to gender bias, with significant performance discrepancies.

- Other emotions like "Happy," "Sad," and "Neutral" also show notable biases, favoring female facial image data.

- Balanced datasets help reduce gender bias, ensuring more equitable performance across genders.

## Implications
The research contributes to the broader discourse on fairness and ethics in AI, emphasizing the need for equitable machine learning models.
It provides actionable insights for developing fairer and more accurate FER technologies, ensuring responsible AI development.
## Future Directions
- Expand the scope of datasets to include a wider range of demographic variables, such as age and ethnicity.

- Explore ensemble learning techniques to enhance model robustness and mitigate bias.

- Investigate real-world applications of FER models, prioritizing ethical considerations in deployment.

- Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to develop socially responsible FER systems.
